## 1. Machine Learning & ML Life Cycle:

- ML is a branch of AI focuses on the development of the statistical models / algorithm.

- ML Life Cycle is a process guiding the development and deployment of the ML models in a structured way consisting of various steps as follows:

1. Problem Definition.
2. Data Collection.
3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.
4. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).
5. Feature Engineering and Selection.
6. Model Selection -> Choosing the best suitable model.
7. Training Model.
8. Model Evaluation and Tuning.
9. Model Deployment.
10. Model Monitoring and Maintenence.

## 2. Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning:

   - Model trained on **labelled dataset**. [having input and output parameters both].
   - examples: Classification Models, Regression models, Random Forest, etc...

2. Unsupervised Learning:

   - Model trained on the datasets that are **unlabelled** [unknown output].
   - examples: Clustering methods...

3. Reinforcement Learning:

   - reward/feedback based learning.
   - examples: Gaming, Agents, etc...

4. Semi-supervised Learning:

   - Few labelled data and large amount of unlabelled data.
   - Unlabelled data are kinda labelled here...

## 3. Difference Between ML/DL:

- DL is basically a subset of ML utilizing Neural Networks and its multiple layers.

- DL consists of the following things:

1. ANN - Artificial Neural Networks.
2. CNN - Convolutional Neural Networks. [Image based data -> Generally we use computer vision library along with here.]
3. RNN - Recurrent Neural Networks. [sequential kinda data is used here -> Textual based data is kinda used here (so we also use NLP thing here)] -> LSTM & GRU
4. GAN - Generative Adversarial Networks.
5. Transformers [GPT, BERT, etc... llms and all are based on transformer models].

## 4. Computer Vision vs NLP:

- **Computer Vision:** This is a library deals with processing and analyzing image or video based data.
- **NLP:** Natural Language Processing is a method to preprocess and analyze the textual based data. `nltk` library is used for basic NLP related tasks.
