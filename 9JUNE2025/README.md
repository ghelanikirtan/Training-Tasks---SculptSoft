# TASKS [9TH JUNE 2025]:

- In the Cricket Dataset [From Kaggle], do perform the proper analysis, Data Preprocessing [feature engineering and whatever applicable], and then apply the KNN [K Nearest Neighbours] algorithm to classify the positions of the batter [which batter should go for batting first and which should go later...]

- Apply Naive Bayes Algorithm in Iris Dataset as well.
